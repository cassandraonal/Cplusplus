error fixing:
Cassandra Sbordoni
(that's why my name is next to every file, I did work on all of them and fix errors that I found.)

Joseph Bernabe has worked on steps 7-9. I did have to do the whole step 7 though because it was not there when I checked. 
Although he may have worked on it and forgot to push that part, I'm not sure. 
I also had to go through and edit some portions of the sortByID() and sortByName() to make it run correctly, but most of the code he did was correct.
I had to work to get menu choices 3. Add Students from CSV File,5. Add Faculty from Text File, 6. Add Faculty from CSV File, 11. Sort by ID, and
12. Sort by Name to properly display the expected output.
LinkedList.h: addFacultyFromConsole(), addFacultyFromTxtFile(), addFacultyFromCSVFile()
sortByID(), sortByName(), sortByGPA()

Cassandra added txt files for testing also
